        <h2>June 20, 2020</h2>
        <p>Thankful for the opportunity to intern at Fidelity this summer.</p>

        <h2>March 1, 2020</h2>
        <p>What a ride it has been these past few weeks! I am fortunate and grateful to God for giving me the opportunity to become a Caldwell Fellow. It is an honor but also an exciting possibility of new friendships and mentors. This past weekend, I traveled with the other classmates in the Class of 2023 to a retreat in Greensboro where we focused on building community and deeper relationships. Lately, I have been reminding myself to remember to remain humble, ambitious, and hardworking. I have been trying to focus on what matters most in my life, organizing my priorities, and being efficient. A lesson learned from my conversations with others is an attitude of gratitude and service and not taking things for granted. Our time on earth is short and quick-lived; do not live life in such a way that you will regret looking backward. As exams and projects come up before the spring break, keep up the persistence and hard work. Good night!</p>

        <h2>December 18, 2019</h2>
        <p>The last day of the semester! Tonight, I will be practicing my interview skills as I have appointment with the Career Development Center advisor tomorrow. My goal over this Christmas break is to make the best use of my time. I will write my application for the Caldwell Fellows program, take the Java 8 certification exam, brush up my Chinese, participate in the IBM Mainframe competition, and spend quality time with my family.</p>

        <h2>November 30, 2019</h2>
        <p>It looks like final exams are just around the corner. I need to improve my productivity, finish my final projects, and start studying for physics, calculus, discrete math, and computer science.</p>
