        <p>As of Fall 2019, I am a first year student at NC State University, majoring in 
        Computer Science. I enjoy spending time with my family and meeting new friends. 
        My current interests in the field of computer science include building iOS apps, 
        Python, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and AWS.</p>

        <p>Hi, my name is Michael Dacanay. I was born and raised in Raleigh, North
        Carolina. I am 19 years old and this coming semester, I will be in the second 
        semester of my first year at university. I will be taking data structures and 
        algorithms, c software and tools, economics, linear algebra, introduction to 
        entrepreneurship, and grammars, computability, and automata. At school, I am 
        involved with the Scholars Program, 1887 fellows, IBM Pathfinder program, and 
        Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and CRU Christian fellowship.</p>

        <p>At Shodor, I was an apprentice during the 2016-2017 year. I joined Shodor to 
        learn more about computer science, gain essential office and life skills. I had a 
        great time at Shodor. I met many new friends and they are so inspiring. They are 
        skilled in one way or another and I can't wait to continue being friends. As 
        apprentices, we learned about new languages and software like php, html, mysql, 
        css, vensim, agentcubes, gimp, inkscape, and linux. Using what we have learned, I 
        completed various projects. This experience at Shodor was very memorable. The 
        atmosphere was lively and joyful whenever we played cards during our breaks. It is 
        always a great stress-reliever.</p>
        
        <p>I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. Several years ago, we went to 
        China, which was really fun! We visited Beijing, Xi An, Wu Han, Jing Zhou, the 
        Yang Tze River, Chong Qing, and Shang Hai. We saw many world heritage sites, among 
        them were the Great Wall of China, Terricotta Warriors, the Temple of Heavenly 
        Peace, the Red Pagoda, and so much more. I especially loved seeing the Panda bears 
        in Chong Qing. This was a wonderful global experience. More recently, I returned 
        back to China on an internship with Sutherland Global Services where I served at 
        GTI (Global Technology Infrastructure) intern. I assisted my team lead in
        resolving problems related to both hardware and software. We serviced clients such 
        as Alibaba and this required that we prepare the software on the computers for our 
        employees to best serve them. This experience was one of the best in my life and I
        made friends and experiences that will last a lifetime.</p>

        <p>Currently, I have a part-time job at theCoderSchool where I teach elementary 
        and middle school aged students how to code. I have been teaching there since 
        August of 2018. I taught there on Thursdays and Saturdays, but with my transition 
        to university I can now only work on weekends. As I see the kids develop their 
        problem solving skills, it makes me happy that I can contribute to the growth of 
        the next generation of computer scientists and programmers.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing cello. I have played this instrument for about 
        seven years. I started playing it in 6th grade and ever since, my passion for 
        cello has continued. In my years of playing cello, I was part Sinfonia, Triangle 
        Youth Orchestra, NC Film Orchestra, North Carolina Chamber Institute (Ritornello 
        Piano Quartet), Melos, and Leesville Chamber Orchestra. One of my favorite pieces 
        to perform is Seitz Piano Quartet Op. 35.  It is elegant and combines different 
        techniques.  Another stirring piece is Seitz' Concerto No. 3 in G minor for the 
        violin. My sister is currently playing it and I can't wait until she perfects it 
        because it sounds amazing.</p>

        <p>My favorite sport is basketball. When I was born I already knew that I loved 
        basketball. I also enjoy playing volleyball, ping pong, badminton, and swimming. 
        Another of my passions, is the game of chess. In my elementary years, my friends 
        and I really enjoyed participating at local tournaments. I enjoy going to youth 
        group with my friends during Wednesdays. Last but not least, I am very thankful to 
        my family. They are very loving and supportive.</p>

        <p>In the future, I hope to be able to work on important technologies in the tech 
        industry, especially data science and machine learning. My purpose in life is to 
        make a positive impact on the people around me.</p>
